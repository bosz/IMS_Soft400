Web-based Online Inventory Management System(IMS) for the IMS_Soft400 Team
==========================================================================

This will be the work plan for the week and the required mile stones

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Monday 12th January, 2015 - Wednesday 14th January, 2015
	
  This time will be the time we are looking at the sales binder site(http://www.salesbinder.com).
  Each and everyone of us will create an account on it an tour it to see how it functions so we can 
  better understand the concept of IMS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Everyone should atleast at this point know about IMS and have toured the site and know how it functions
  so that we can code ours with no problem.
  
 - Thurday 15th January, 2015 - Sunday 18th January, 2015
 
   We shall be holding meetings on how to design the database for the system and also along site 
   revising our laravel, php and web skill preparing for the coding to begin. Also we should be reading
   some docs online concerning IMS, Git(version control system).
   
 - Mile Stone
 
   At this level, everyone should know how to use Git(version control) and also how to code on laravel.
   Also we will have designed our database and set for coding the system in little or no time from now.
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: 
  We shall be using git for our version control and each and everyone of us will create his/her own separate
  branch in the project from the master branch. Working on your own branch will be like modularizing the project
  and everyone has a copy of the project. When ever you are done with your part or you have reached a particular
  milestone, you can commit(pull) the changes to the master branch so that any other team member can pull the master
  branch to sync it with his/her own. So the master branch is the full project which is working.
  For example: 
  	Since we are 4 of us on the project, we shall have 4 branches and 1 master branch
  	Melvis branch-----------|
  				|
  				|
  	Roc4rd brach------------|
  				|---------------> master branch
  				|
  	Isidores branch---------|
  				|
  				|
  	d3r1ck branch-----------|
  	
 So when we make changes to our branch, we should push it to the master branch so that everyone can pull the master
 branch and see the progress of your work. This happens for everybody and the master branch holds the final copy
 of the system.
 
 For further details, we shall have a meeting tomorrow so that we discuss and further our explanation in the document.
